# APPetite-Project

This application is designed to prompt a user to input food or drink ingredients and to supply recipes that include those ingredients.

## Motivation
Have you ever opened up your fridge only to realize that you don't know what to make with what's in there? Or have you been at the grocery store and seen a fantastic sale on pork, only to realize you don't know any pork dishes? This app can help. All you need to do is list out ingredients that you have on hand, and it will return results that use those ingredients.
